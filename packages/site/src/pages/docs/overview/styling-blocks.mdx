## Hashtag `#` Commands

Most blocks accept `#` commands. These commands allow you to style the block.

In general there are two categories of commands:

- **Universal commands** - Some blocks support one-word commands like `#dark` or
  `#left`, which influence the style or behavior of many aspects of the block.
- **Tailwind commands** - Other blocks support
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes like `#text-gray-500` or
  `#bg-gray-100`, which influence the style of very specific aspects of the
  block.

You can find the list of supported commands for each block by typing `#` and
browsing the list, or by checking the [Block Reference](/app/docs/blocks) page
for that block.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not sure how to style a block, there are a few steps you can try:

- First, check the available `#` commands. Type `#` and search or scroll through
  the list to see if you can find what you're looking for.
- Next, you may be able to detach the block. This allows you to style the nested
  blocks independently. To detach a block, click it and then click the Detach
  icon <InlineIcon name="LinkBreak2Icon" />. Note that not all blocks support
  detaching.
- Last, you can
