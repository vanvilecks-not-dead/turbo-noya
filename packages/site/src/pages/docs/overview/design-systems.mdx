## Choosing a base design system

Noya currently supports a single base design system,
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). We chose Chakra for its simplicity and ease
of use in React code. We plan to add first-class support for more open source
design systems in the future, including [MUI](https://mui.com/) and
[Ant Design](https://ant.design/).

## Importing your company's design system

Importing a custom design system isn't supported yet. If you're interested in
being an early adopter of this feature, please
