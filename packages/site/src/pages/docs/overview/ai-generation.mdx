## AI-generated content to speed up wireframing

Some blocks in Noya have the ability to use AI to generate content. This is
often useful as a way to brainstorm, create a first draft, or as placeholder
content that is more realistic than "lorem ipsum". In some cases, the content
will be good enough to use as your final content after a few refinements.

When a block includes AI generation, you need to provide a little bit of
information to specify the context and goals for the generated content, and the
AI will take it from there. This information is provided by editing the contents
of a block by double clicking it or pressing `Enter`.

The specific information required depends on the block. Providing the
information that yields the results you want takes a little bit of getting used
to, so feel free to experiment by trying different inputs and seeing what you
get.

Content is generated in real time as you modify the input, so you'll see a
loading indicator while the AI is working. If the result is not exactly what you
want, you can often adjust your input to be more specific and guide the AI into
the right direction.

## Write block

The Write block generates text content based on a short prompt input, which can
be a few words or even an instruction. Here are some examples of inputs and the
text content that was generated:

> provides a creamy, slightly sweet taste. Both soymilk and oatmilk can be used
> as a substitute for cow's milk in many recipes, though oatmilk is typically
> used more for beverages and cereal while soymilk is more popular for baking.
