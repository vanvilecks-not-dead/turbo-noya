## Switching between views

To switch between views, click the View button in the top right corner of your
project. Then select the desired view.

## Split View

This view splits the screen into an editable wireframe view on the left side and
a high-fidelity preview on the right side. This allows you to focus on the
wireframe separately from the high-fidelity output.

You can resize the two views by dragging the vertical split bar between them.
Resizing based on what feels right is important to make this view usable, so
feel free to resize as frequently as you need. For example, while you are
actively editing the wireframe, you may want to make the wireframe view larger.
If you have a wide screen where you can see both views at 100%, you may want to
make both views equally sized.

## Combined View

This view combines the editable wireframe and the high-fidelity preview. This is
a more compact view that allows you to see everything in one place. There is
less distinction between the wireframe and the high-fidelity output. It lets you
directly manipulate the high-fidelity output, because double clicking on a
high-fidelity output element will enter its block editing mode.

## Live Preview

This view shows you only the high-fidelity output. It is great for previewing
what the final product may look like without any distractions.
