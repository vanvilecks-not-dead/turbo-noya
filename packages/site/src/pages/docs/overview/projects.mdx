## What is a Project?

A Noya project represents the wireframe for an individual screen of a website or
app.

> We're working on adding support for multiple screens in a single project - for
> now, your best option may be to duplicate your existing project when you want
> to design another similar screen.

## Configuring a Project

You can configure a project's name, canvas size, and design system via the
dropdown menu that shows the project's name in the toolbar.

<img src={ProjectConfiguration.src} alt="Project configuration menu" />

## Duplicating a Project

You can duplicate a project from the dropdown menu shown above, or by right
clicking from the projects list:

<img
  src={ProjectContextMenu.src}
  alt="Project context menu"
  style={{ border: '1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)' }}
/>
