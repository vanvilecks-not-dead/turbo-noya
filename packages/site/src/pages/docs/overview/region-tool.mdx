## How it Works

The region tool lets you select multiple blocks, even when there may be another
block directly under the cursor.

You can activate the region tool by clicking the <InlineIcon name="GroupIcon" />
icon in the toolbar, or by holding the `Shift` key.

## Selection Behavior

Insipired by CAD software, the region tool has two different selection behaviors
based on the direction you drag after clicking:

- **Left to right** - Select any block that the region tool touches (this is the
  selection behavior of Figma & Sketch)
- **Right to left** - Select only fully enclosed blocks

Selecting enclosed blocks is useful when you want to select blocks that have
another block in the background behind them.
