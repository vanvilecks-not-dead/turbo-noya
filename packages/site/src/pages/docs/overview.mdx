## A better way to wireframe

Noya is a wireframing tool based around the concept of **blocks**. A **block**
is a wireframe-like representation of a UI component such as "Hero" or "Button".
The Noya tool automatically generates a high-fidelity output in real time by
mapping low-fidelity blocks into high-fidelity design system and React
components.

## Why?

Traditionally, thereâ€™s a tricky tradeoff between working in low-fidelity
wireframes vs. high-fidelity mockups when working on a product idea. Working in
low-fidelity allows for quick iteration while hammering out the big picture, but
people often have a hard time imagining the final product.

Because of this, teams frequently jump to high-fidelity and stop using
wireframes too early, which slows down progress dramatically as they spend an
excessive amount of time perfecting unimportant details.
