import { radioSymbolId } from '../../../../ayon/blocks/symbolIds';

## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview blockId={radioSymbolId} />

## Configuration

You can configure the radio with text, which will appear as a label to the
right. If you do not want a label, resize the block to a square that fits only
the radio. The radio has a few different states that can be configured by
adding:

- `#off` - to deselect the radio (default)
- `#on` - to select the radio
- `#disabled` - to disable the radio

Here's an example with a text label, `#on` and `#disabled`:

<InteractiveBlockPreview
  blockId={radioSymbolId}
  blockText="Only on Fridays #on #disabled"
/>
