import { selectSymbolId } from '../../../../ayon/blocks/symbolIds';

## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview blockId={selectSymbolId} />

## Configuration

Each item in the select should be on a separate line.

You can further configure the select's style by adding:

- `#dark` - to use the dark theme
- `#accent` - to use the accent color variant of the theme
- `#disabled` - to disable the select

Here's an example configuration that uses these options (double click to edit):

<InteractiveBlockPreview
  blockId={selectSymbolId}
  blockText={`Category
Apartment
Condo
House
#dark #accent #disabled`}
/>
