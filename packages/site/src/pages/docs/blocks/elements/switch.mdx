import { switchSymbolId } from '../../../../ayon/blocks/symbolIds';

## Live Preview

You can double click the block to edit its contents.

<InteractiveBlockPreview blockId={switchSymbolId} />

## Configuration

The switch has a few different states that can be configured by adding:

- `#off` - to switch to the off position (default)
- `#on` - to switch to the on position
- `#disabled` - to disable the switch

Here's an example with `#on` and `#disabled`:

<InteractiveBlockPreview blockId={switchSymbolId} blockText="#on #disabled" />
