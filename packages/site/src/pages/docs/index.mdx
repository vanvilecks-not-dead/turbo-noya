## Introduction

Noya is a new kind of design tool that offers the best of both low-fidelity
wireframes and high fidelity designs.

These docs will show you how to quickly design applications, marketing pages,
and more using the Noya tool. The docs are broken down into two main sections:

1. [Overview](/app/docs/overview) - A brief tour of the most important parts of
   the Noya tool
2. [Block Reference](/app/docs/blocks) - A reference of all the available blocks
   and how to use them

If you're not sure where to start, we recommend reading through the
[Overview](/app/docs/overview) section.
